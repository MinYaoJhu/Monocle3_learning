# The cell_data_set class

Monocle holds single-cell expression data in objects of the cell_data_set class. The class is derived from the Bioconductor SingleCellExperiment class, which provides a common interface familiar to those who have analyzed other single-cell experiments with Bioconductor. The class requires three input files:

expression_matrix, a numeric matrix of expression values, where rows are genes, and columns are cells
cell_metadata, a data frame, where rows are cells, and columns are cell attributes (such as cell type, culture condition, day captured, etc.)
gene_metadata, an data frame, where rows are features (e.g. genes), and columns are gene attributes, such as biotype, gc content, etc.

## Generate a cell_data_set


``` r
# Load the data
expression_matrix <- readRDS(url("https://depts.washington.edu:/trapnell-lab/software/monocle3/celegans/data/cao_l2_expression.rds"))
cell_metadata <- readRDS(url("https://depts.washington.edu:/trapnell-lab/software/monocle3/celegans/data/cao_l2_colData.rds"))
gene_annotation <- readRDS(url("https://depts.washington.edu:/trapnell-lab/software/monocle3/celegans/data/cao_l2_rowData.rds"))


# Make the CDS object
cds <- new_cell_data_set(expression_matrix,
                         cell_metadata = cell_metadata,
                         gene_metadata = gene_annotation)
```
