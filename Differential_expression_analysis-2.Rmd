# Finding genes that change as a function of pseudotime

Identifying the genes that change as cells progress along a trajectory is a core objective of this type of analysis. Knowing the order in which genes go on and off can inform new models of development. For example, Sharon and Chawla et al recently analyzed pseudotime-dependent genes to arrive at a whole new model of how islets form in the pancreas.

Let's return to the embryo data, which we processed using the commands

```{r}
expression_matrix <- readRDS(url("https://depts.washington.edu:/trapnell-lab/software/monocle3/celegans/data/packer_embryo_expression.rds"))
cell_metadata <- readRDS(url("https://depts.washington.edu:/trapnell-lab/software/monocle3/celegans/data/packer_embryo_colData.rds"))
gene_annotation <- readRDS(url("https://depts.washington.edu:/trapnell-lab/software/monocle3/celegans/data/packer_embryo_rowData.rds"))
cds <- new_cell_data_set(expression_matrix,
                         cell_metadata = cell_metadata,
                         gene_metadata = gene_annotation)
cds <- preprocess_cds(cds, num_dim = 50)
cds <- align_cds(cds, alignment_group = "batch", residual_model_formula_str = "~ bg.300.loading + bg.400.loading + bg.500.1.loading + bg.500.2.loading + bg.r17.loading + bg.b01.loading + bg.b02.loading")
cds <- reduce_dimension(cds)
cds <- cluster_cells(cds)
cds <- learn_graph(cds)

```

```{r}
cds <- order_cells(cds)

```

```{r}
plot_cells(cds,
           color_cells_by = "cell.type",
           label_groups_by_cluster=FALSE,
           label_leaves=FALSE,
           label_branch_points=FALSE)
```



How do we find the genes that are differentially expressed on the different paths through the trajectory? How do we find the ones that are restricted to the beginning of the trajectory? Or excluded from it?

Once again, we turn to graph_test(), this time passing it neighbor_graph="principal_graph", which tells it to test whether cells at similar positions on the trajectory have correlated expression:

```{r}
ciliated_cds_pr_test_res <- graph_test(cds, neighbor_graph="principal_graph", cores=1)
pr_deg_ids <- row.names(subset(ciliated_cds_pr_test_res, q_value < 0.05))
```

Here are a couple of interesting genes that score as highly significant according to graph_test():

```{r}
plot_cells(cds, genes=c("hlh-4", "gcy-8", "dac-1", "oig-8"),
           show_trajectory_graph=FALSE,
           label_cell_groups=FALSE,
           label_leaves=FALSE)
```

As before, we can collect the trajectory-variable genes into modules:

```{r}
gene_module_df <- find_gene_modules(cds[pr_deg_ids,], resolution=c(10^seq(-6,-1)))
```

Here we plot the aggregate module scores within each group of cell types as annotated by Packer & Zhu et al:

```{r}
cell_group_df <- tibble::tibble(cell=row.names(colData(cds)), 
                                cell_group=colData(cds)$cell.type)
agg_mat <- aggregate_gene_expression(cds, gene_module_df, cell_group_df)
row.names(agg_mat) <- stringr::str_c("Module ", row.names(agg_mat))
pheatmap::pheatmap(agg_mat,
                   scale="column", clustering_method="ward.D2")
```

We can also pass gene_module_df to plot_cells() as we did when we compared clusters in the L2 data above.

```{r}
plot_cells(cds,
           genes=gene_module_df %>% filter(module %in% c(27, 10, 7, 30)),
           label_cell_groups=FALSE,
           show_trajectory_graph=FALSE)
```

Monocle offers another plotting function that can sometimes give a clearer view of a gene's dynamics along a single path. You can select a path with choose_cells() or by subsetting the cell data set by cluster, cell type, or other annotation that's restricted to the path. Let's pick one such path, the AFD cells:

```{r}
AFD_genes <- c("gcy-8", "dac-1", "oig-8")
AFD_lineage_cds <- cds[rowData(cds)$gene_short_name %in% AFD_genes,
                       colData(cds)$cell.type %in% c("AFD")]
AFD_lineage_cds <- order_cells(AFD_lineage_cds)
```

The function plot_genes_in_pseudotime() takes a small set of genes and shows you their dynamics as a function of pseudotime:

```{r}
plot_genes_in_pseudotime(AFD_lineage_cds,
                         color_cells_by="embryo.time.bin",
                         min_expr=0.5)
```

You can see that dac-1 is activated before the other two genes.
